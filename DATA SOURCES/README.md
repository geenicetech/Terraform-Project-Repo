## Terraform Azure Infrastructure Project

This Terraform project demonstrates the creation of an Azure infrastructure composed of a virtual network, a simple virtual machine, 2 virtual machines allocated to an availability set, and a storage account with a blob file uploaded to the container. The project utilizes Terraform's data blocks to unify different Terraform files for a cohesive deployment.
